[Finn](http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Finn) and [Jake](http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Jake) hitch a ride on a Citadel Guardian after he imprisons and transports [The Lich](http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/The_Lich_(character)) to the Citadel. Upon arrival, the Guardian attaches The Lich's crystal prison onto a much larger crystal "cell block." Finn then says it is a good riddance for The Lich.<!--more--> As they talk, The Lich begins emitting a gray breath in his cell which the duo don't notice. Finn and Jake then look around for Finn's long-lost father, whom Finn initially suggests might be a Guardian. Jake points out a strange looking "old kid" who resembles Finn, and it turns out to be Finn's father incarcerated inside a crystal jail cell.
